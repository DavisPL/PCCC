Vulnerability Analysis: User Score Updater
The primary vulnerability in this code is a race condition due to lack of proper synchronization (CWE-662). This can occur in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment where multiple instances of the function might try to update the same user's score simultaneously.

How It Could Be Exploited
Consider this scenario:

User Alice has a current score of 100.
Two separate processes call update_user_score("alice", 10) at nearly the same time.

What could happen:

Process A reads the current score (100)
Process B reads the current score (100)
Process A calculates new score (110) and writes it
Process B calculates new score (110) and writes it

The end result is that Alice's score is 110, even though it should be 120 (100 + 10 + 10).
