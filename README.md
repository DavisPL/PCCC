# Introduction
PC**3 is a framweork to verify if the codes are generated (or completed - as the future work) satisfy preselected safety properties by the user (These safety properties are chosen and converted to verification conditions manually in the current version).


# Installation
## Requirements
### Install Dafny
- Use [Dafny official user installation instruction](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL) to install Dafny ``version 4.6.0`` on a unix-based system.
- Make sure that dafny is accessible from the command line and verify the version by trying 
```
dafny --version
```
It should be <b>=4.6.0</b>
### Python Version
Install [python](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html) ``version >=3.12.3``
- Check python version 
```
python --version
```
It should be <b>>=3.12.3</b>

### Install requirenents
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requiremetns.
To install required packages you can simply use the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install required packages separately using pip 
```
pip install openai==1.35.9
pip install anthropic==0.34.2
pip install langchain==0.2.7
pip install lunary==1.1.3
```
## Configuration
Use the env.config file and modify it to add your desired configurations to work with PCCC.
env.config includes two main parts to set the requirements for the tool execution and the configureations required for the few-shot prompting. 
1. The deafault configuration of the tool includes the following sections:
- API keys: the API keys for the desired LLM and also Lunary API for tracking to this part
- Model parameters: LLM parameters including the LLM model, coold down time, temperature (= 0.75), max number of tokens (= 4000)
- Required files: Set the absolute path for the following files:
    - Set absolute path for the input task that is the absolute path to src/tasks/task-6.json
    - Set absolute base path for the output that is the absolute path to output
# Effectful interface API path (absolute path)
interface_path =  /Users/pari/pcc-llms/filesystems-api/interface/effectful-interface.dfy

2. The prompting configuration needs absolute path to required files
## How does it work?

```
cd src
python3 main.py
```
