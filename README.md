# Introduction
PC<sup>3</sup> (proof carrying code completions) is a Dafny framework for generating code together with a proof of a safety property selected by the user.
PC3 is a research prototype; it has the following current limitations:

- Currently, PC3 supports code generation (i.e, full function bodies) and support for code completions is work-in-progress.
- Our current implementation uses a prompt generation template and a validation step similar to [dafny-synthesis](https://github.com/Mondego/dafny-synthesis) developed by Misu et. al.
- The safety properties are chosen and converted to verification conditions manually in the current version.


# Installation
## Clone PC<sup>3</sup> Repository
1. Clone PC<sup>3</sup> repository using this link `https://github.com/DavisPL/PCCC.git`
## Dependencies
### Install Dafny
1. Use [Dafny official user installation instruction](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/wiki/INSTALL) to install Dafny ``version 4.6.0`` on a unix-based system.
2. Make sure that dafny is accessible from the command line and verify the version by trying `dafny --version`. The output should be <b>=4.6.0</b>
### Install Python
1. Use [python](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html) official documentation to install a python with ``version >=3.12.3``.
2. Check python version `python --version`. The output should be <b>>=3.12.3</b>
---

### Requirenents
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requiremetns.

Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment` for instance: `python3 -m venv pccc-venv`
Activate the virtuale environment using `source pccc-venv/bin/activate` for a unix-based system and `pccc-venv\Scripts\activate.bat` for a linux-based system. In case of having any issue or requiring more details please refer to [python doumentation on creation of virtula environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

To install required packages you can simply use the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install required packages separately using pip 
```
pip install openai==1.35.9
pip install anthropic==0.34.2
pip install langchain==0.2.7
pip install lunary==1.1.3
```
---
# Configuration
Use the [env.config](./env.config) file and modify it to add your desired configurations to work with PCCC.
env.config includes two main parts to set the requirements for the tool execution and the configureations required for the few-shot prompting. 
1. The deafault configuration of the tool includes the following sections:
    - API keys: the API keys for the required autoregressive transformer model and also Lunary API for looging the input to the model and the model's response.
      If you only would like to use openAI models you need to add openai_api_key and also set the model
    ```
        # OpenAI API KEY
        openai_api_key = your-api-key
        # LLM to be used 'gpt-4'
        model = gpt-4
    ```
    If you wourd like to switch to another model, simply remove the openai_api_key and add the new_api_key for another model.

> [!NOTE]  
> Currently, our tool only supports openAI and Claude.
> Adding lunary_api_key is optional. If you use lunary for logging the prompt and the model's response you need to add it to as below:
```
    # Lunary API KEY 
    lunary_api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
```
    - Model parameters: LLM parameters including the LLM model, coold down time, temperature (= 0.75), max number of tokens (= 4000)
    - Required files: Set the absolute path for the following files:
        - Set the absolute path for the input task [task 6 json file](./src/tasks/task-6.json)
        - Set the absolute base path for the output [output](./output/)
        - Set the absolute path for the effectful interface APIs to allow the tool to include it in the generated code [effectful interface](./filesystems-api/interface/effectful-interface.dfy)

2. The prompting configuration needs absolute path to required files
    - Set RAG examples by adding the absolute path to the [json file including RAG example](./benchmark/RAG_samples.json)
    - Set the absolute path to the [json file that includes APIs of the effectful interface] (./benchmark/interface_api.json)
    - Set the number of few shot exampels in the  [Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompt template]()  5 in our exper

# Usage
1. Switch to the [source folder](./src/) and run the [main.py](./src/main.py) file to run the tool
```
cd src
python3 main.py
```

2. The output files are available in [output directory](./src/output)
    - files with verification_log suffix shows the status of the generated code at each try
        - If the generated code is verified the output is 
        ```
            Dafny program verifier finished with 1 verified, 0 errors
        ```
        - If the generated code cannot be verified with Dafny compiler the output shows the line of code that caused the error:
        ```
                |
             10 |    requires has_valid_path_length(directory + filename);
                |    ^

                1 parse errors detected in task_id_6-gpt-4-temp_0.75-k_1.dfy
        ```
    - Generated dafny codes for each attept are saved in the files with .dfy extension.
    - For each attempt a json file includes the config, total number of errors, few shot examples id and the generated code, and the model response with a template like the following one:
    ```
    {"id": "6", "K": 2, "temperature": 0.75, "task_id": "6", "task_description": "Your task is to implement a function which takes the filename as a parameter, which will then be used to create a full file path in a predetermined directory ( e.g.,'/home/user/documents').", "model": "gpt-4", "dafny_code": "method CreateFullPath(filename: seq<char>) returns (fullpath: seq<char>)\n requires is_valid_file_name(filename)\n requires !has_dangerous_pattern(filename)\n requires has_valid_file_length(filename)\n {\n   var directory: seq<char> := \"/home/user/documents\";\n   fullpath := Join(directory, filename);\n }", "isVerified": true, "code_example_shots": "5", "code_response": "Follow these steps to complete the task:\n\n\nStep 1: Analyze and select the required APIs and their preconditions from the list of API reference.\nFor this task:\n - method Join(p: path, f: file) returns(result: path)\n requires non_empty_string(f)\n requires non_empty_string(p)\n requires !has_dangerous_pattern(f)\n requires !has_dangerous_pattern(p)\n requires has_absoloute_path(f)\n requires is_valid_file_name(f)\n requires is_valid_path_name(p)\n requires has_valid_file_length(f)\n requires has_valid_path_length(p)\n requires has_valid_path_length(p+f)\n\nStep 2:  Implement the Dafny code for the described task, adhering to the provided structure for each API. Utilize the provided API list and their specifications.\nProvide the implementation in Dafny syntax as follows:\n\n```dafny\ninclude \"/Users/pari/pcc-llms/filesystems-api/interface/effectful-interface.dfy\"\n\nmethod CreateFullPath(filename: seq<char>) returns (fullpath: seq<char>)\n requires is_valid_file_name(filename)\n requires !has_dangerous_pattern(filename)\n requires has_valid_file_length(filename)\n {\n   var directory: seq<char> := \"/home/user/documents\";\n   fullpath := Join(directory, filename);\n }\n```\nThe method `CreateFullPath` takes a filename as its parameter and appends it to the directory path \"/home/user/documents\" to create a full path. The filename must be a valid file name, have a valid file length and should not contain any dangerous pattern.", "code_examples_ids": ["4", "1", "3", "5", "2"], "total_no_errors": 0}
    ```
    - A json file includes the output of last attempt that is similar to the output described above.
