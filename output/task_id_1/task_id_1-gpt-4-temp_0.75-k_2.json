It returns `jointPath` which is also a sequence of characters.\n\nThe method has preconditions that check for dangerous patterns in the filename and path, validates the path and filename, and checks if the filename is an absolute path.\n\nPlease note that the `Join`, `has_dangerous_pattern`, `has_absoloute_path`, `is_valid_path_name`, `is_valid_file_name`, `has_valid_file_length`, `has_valid_path_length`, and `append_file_to_path` methods are not defined here and are supposed to be provided from an implemented library.", "code_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "2", "3", "5"]}
