This function checks if the filename is not empty and does not contain '..' or '/'. If the filename is invalid, we raise a ValueError. If the filename is valid, we use `os.path.join` to create the full file path. The `os.path.join` function is safe to use because it automatically handles any nuances related to the operating system's file path syntax.\n\nNote: This is a simple example and doesn't handle all possible safety properties and verification conditions mentioned above.
