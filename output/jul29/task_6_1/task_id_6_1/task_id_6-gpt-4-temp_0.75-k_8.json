It then creates the full file path by joining the filename with a predetermined base directory. Before opening the file, it checks if the full file path length exceeds the maximum limit. If any of these checks fail, it returns `False` and `None`. Otherwise, it opens the file and returns `True` and the file object. \n\nPlease note that you might need to adjust the maximum allowed length for a filename and a path depending on your operating system, and the base directory depending on your application's requirements.", "code_example_shots": "5", "code_response": "In this case, we will use the `SafeJoinAPI` method from the `FileStream` class to join the filename with the predetermined directory path.
