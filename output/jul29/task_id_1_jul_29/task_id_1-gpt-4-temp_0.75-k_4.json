We also make sure to only allow absolute paths for the file name, and that both the path and file name are valid and don't exceed the maximum allowed length. The PathJoin function is then used to safely join the file name with the path, and the result is stored in jointPath.", "code_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "2", "3", "5"], "spec_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "5"]}
