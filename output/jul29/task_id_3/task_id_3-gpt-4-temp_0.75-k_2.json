This code will ensure the safety properties and verification conditions mentioned above. Here is a simple Dafny code snippet:\n\n```dafny\nmethod AppendFileToPath(path: seq<char>, file: seq<char>) returns (result: seq<char>)\n    requires !IsDangerousPath(path)\n    requires !IsDangerousPath(file)\n    requires HasAbsolutePath(file)\n    requires IsValidPathName(path)\n    requires IsValidFileName(file)\n    requires HasValidFileLength(file)\n    requires HasValidPathLength(path)\n    requires HasValidPathLength(path + file)\n    ensures result == path + file || result == path\n    ensures HasValidPathLength(result) || 0 <= |result|\n{\n    if HasValidFileLength(file) && HasValidPathLength(path + file) {\n        result := path + file;\n    }\n    else {\n        result := path;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis method accepts two arguments, `path` and `file`, and returns the `result`. The `requires` clause is used to specify preconditions that should be satisfied before executing the method. The `ensures` clause is used for postconditions that are guaranteed to hold after the execution of the method. The method body consists of a conditional statement that checks if the length of the file name and the total length of the path and file name are valid. If they are, it appends the file name to the path, otherwise, it returns the original path. \n\nNote: This is a simplified illustration, the actual implementation can vary based on the specific requirements and definition of the predicates and functions such as `IsDangerousPath`, `HasAbsolutePath`, `IsValidPathName`, `IsValidFileName`, `HasValidFileLength`, and `HasValidPathLength`. These predicates are supposed to implement the safety properties and verification conditions described above but their actual implementation is not provided here.", "code_example_shots": "5", "code_response": "Alright, let's write a Dafny method to safely append a file to a path. We'll use the safe `SafeJoinAPI` from the `FileStream` class. \n\nHere is the `Append` method:\n\n```dafny\ninclude \"/Users/pari/pcc-llms/dataset/filesystems/interface/effectful-interface.dfy\"\n\nmethod Append(path: seq<char>, fname: seq<char>) returns (jointPath: seq<char>)\n  requires !IsDangerousPath(fname)\n  requires !IsDangerousPath(path)\n  requires HasAbsolutePath(fname)\n  requires IsValidPathName(path)\n  requires IsValidFileName(fname)\n  requires HasValidFileLength(fname)\n  requires HasValidPathLength(path)\n  requires HasValidPathLength(path + fname)\n  ensures PathJoin(path, fname) == jointPath  || jointPath == \"\"\n  ensures HasValidPathLength(jointPath) || jointPath == \"\"\n{\n  // Open the file\n  var ok: bool;\n  var f: FileStream;\n  ok, f := FileStream.SafeOpenAPI(fname);\n  if (!ok) {\n    print \"Failed to open file\\n\";\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Append file to path\n  jointPath := SafeJoinAPI(path, f);\n  if (!HasValidPathLength(jointPath)) {\n    print \"Path name is too long\\n\";\n    jointPath := \"\";\n  }\n\n  // Close the file\n  ok := f.SafeCloseAPI();\n  if (!ok) {\n    print \"Failed to close file\\n\";\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this method we've used several predicates to verify that the file name and path are safe to work with. We've also used the `SafeJoinAPI` method to safely append the file to the path. We ensure that the path is valid and the file is closed at the end of the operation. If anything goes wrong the method will print an error message and return an empty string.", "code_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "2", "3", "5"], "spec_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "3"]}
