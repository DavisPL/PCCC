Ensure that your code adheres strictly to the maximum number of preconditions specified for each API method.\nProvide the implementation in Dafny syntax as follows:\n\n```dafny\ninclude \"/Users/pari/pcc-llms/dataset/filesystems/interface/effectful-interface.dfy\"\n\nmethod MakeFullPath(filename: seq<char>) returns (fullPath: seq<char>)\n requires non_empty_string(filename)\n requires is_valid_file_name(filename)\n requires has_valid_file_length(filename)\n requires !has_dangerous_pattern(filename)\n requires has_absoloute_path(filename)\n {\n   var path: seq<char> := \"/home/user/documents/\"; // predefined directory\n   fullPath := Join(path, filename);\n }\n```\n\nThis Dafny method will take a filename, append it to a hard-coded directory path (i.e., '/home/user/documents'), and return the full path. Please note that this implementation relies on a function named Join, which appends a filename to a path. The exact behavior of this function may vary based on your environment and the programming language you're using. In this case, we're assuming it's a function that correctly handles path manipulations.", "code_examples_ids": ["4", "3", "5", "2", "1"]}
