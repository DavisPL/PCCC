Dafny is used more for proving the correctness of algorithms rather than for system-level programming or file operations. Therefore, Dafny does not support file I/O operations directly in its standard library.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for a more general approach to this problem, here is a way you can model this operation. In this model, we'll assume the existence of a `File` class and a `AppendToFile` method.\n\n```dafny\ninclude \"/Users/pari/pcc-llms/dataset/filesystems/interface/effectful-interface.dfy\"\n\nclass File {\n    var content: seq<char>;\n    \n    method Append(data: seq<char>) \n    modifies this\n    ensures content == old(content) + data\n    {\n        content := content + data;\n    }\n}\n\nmethod AppendToFile(file: File, data: seq<char>) \n  requires file != null \n  ensures file.content == old(file.content) + data \n  {\n      file.Append(data);\n  }\n```\nIn this model, the `File` class has a field `content` that represents the data of the file. The `Append` method of the `File` class appends the provided data to the file. The `AppendToFile` method uses this `Append` method to append data to the file. The `ensures` clause ensures that the content of the file after the operation is the content of the file before the operation appended with the new data. Please note this is a model and doesn't actually perform file I/O operation. \n\nPlease consider using a more suitable language for file I/O operations such as Python, C, C++, Java, etc.", "code_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "3", "2", "5"]}
