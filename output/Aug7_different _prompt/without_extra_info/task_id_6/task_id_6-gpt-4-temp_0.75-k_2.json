Ensure that your code adheres strictly to all the preconditions for each API method.\n\nThe Dafny implementation could look like this:\n\n```dafny\ninclude \"/Users/pari/pcc-llms/dataset/filesystems/interface/effectful-interface.dfy\"\n\nmethod CreateFilePath(fileName: seq<char>) returns (fullPath: seq<char>)\n requires non_empty_string(fileName)\n requires !has_dangerous_pattern(fileName)\n requires is_valid_file_name(fileName)\n requires has_valid_file_length(fileName)\n{\n   var directory: seq<char> := \"/home/user/documents\";\n   fullPath := Join(directory, fileName);\n}\n```\n\nThis function will join the provided filename with the directory path to create a full file path.
