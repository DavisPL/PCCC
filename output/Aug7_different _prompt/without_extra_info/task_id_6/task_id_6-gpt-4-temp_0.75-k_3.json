Before joining the file name with the directory, it checks for certain preconditions such as the filename does not contain any dangerous patterns, it is valid, and its length is within the allowed limit. These preconditions ensure the safety and correctness of the operation.", "code_examples_ids": ["4", "3", "5", "2", "1"]}
