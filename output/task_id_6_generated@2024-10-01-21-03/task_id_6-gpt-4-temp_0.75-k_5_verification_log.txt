/Users/pari/pcc-llms/filesystems-api/interface/effectful-interface.dfy(307,17): Warning: the type of the other operand is a non-null type, so this comparison with 'null' will always return 'true' (to make it possible for variable 'paths' to have the value 'null', declare its type to be 'array?<string>')
