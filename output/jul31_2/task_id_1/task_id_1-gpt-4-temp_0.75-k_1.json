It doesn't natively support file I/O operations or libraries for this. \n\nHowever, you could write the specifications for these operations. Here's how you might specify the 'Append' method, assuming that file I/O operations were supported:\n\n```dafny\ninclude \"/Users/pari/pcc-llms/dataset/filesystems/interface/effectful-interface.dfy\"\n\nmethod AppendToFile(path: seq<char>, fileName: seq<char>)\n  requires IsValidPath(path) && IsValidFileName(fileName)\n  modifies FileSystem()\n  ensures FileSystem().FileAtPath(path + fileName) == old(FileSystem().FileAtPath(path)) + old(FileSystem().FileAtPath(fileName))\n{\n  // The code for appending a file would go here if Dafny supported file I/O operations.\n}\n```\nThis method takes a path and a filename, and it modifies the filesystem. The postcondition states that the file at the given path after the method call is equal to the file at the path before the method call appended with the file with the given filename before the method call.\n\nPlease note that the `IsValidPath`, `IsValidFileName`, and `FileSystem` are just placeholders, as Dafny does not contain these built-in functions or any libraries for file I/O. The actual implementation would depend on the .NET libraries or other APIs that you're using for file I/O operations.", "code_examples_ids": ["1", "4", "2", "3", "5"]}
