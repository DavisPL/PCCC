TASK:

     

AI ASSISTANT:
Step 1: Determine the method signatures.
In this case:
    {{method_signature}}

Step 2: Determine the preconditions.
In this case:
    {{preconditions}}


step 3: Determine required fileIO methods signatures
    {{fileIO_methods_signature_plus_preconditions}}


Step 4: Write the code and use verification methods signatures that help the solver prove the internally implemented verification conditions.
In this case:

```dafny

    {{code}}

```
