Act as a code assistant and provide your response as a JSON object with the following keys:
"description": explanations about the code,
"code": The generated code. The code string is now a single line with \n inserted where the newlines should be.
Ensure that the entire code value is enclosed in double quotes.
Any internal double quotes in the code (if present) would need to be escaped with a backslash (\"), but this isn't necessary in your provided code.
"programming_language": The programming language used to write the code
"req_files": Path to required libraries or files to complete the task
"lis_of_sensitive_files": The sensitive files that the generated code shouldn't access
"safety_property": The given safety property

Then, generate a Dafny code that takes n which is a nat as its input. Calculates fibonacci of n and returns the response using the provided 
json format.
The generated code should have prpoer preconditions, postconditions, assertions and invarients based on Dafny syntax.

programming_language: Dafny
req_files: [./tests/filestream/fileio_with_sensitive_files.dfy]
 
safety_property: CannotAccessSensitiveFiles(l: <List of files>, access: <type of access>)
files = ["bar.txt", "baz.txt"]
access = Read
