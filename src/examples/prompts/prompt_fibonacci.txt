Act as a code assistant and provide your response as a JSON object with the following keys:
"description": explanations about the code,
"code": The generated code. The code string is now a single line with \n inserted where the newlines should be.
Ensure that the entire code value is enclosed in double quotes.
Any internal double quotes in the code (if present) would need to be escaped with a backslash (\"), but this isn't necessary in your provided code.
"programming_language": The programming language used to write the code

Then, Generate a Dafny code that calculate fibonacci of a random number and return response using the provided json format.

 

method Fibonacci(n: nat) returns (res: nat)
{
    if n == 0 then
    {
        res := 0;
    }
    else if n == 1 then
    {
        res := 1;
    }
    else
    {
        var prev := Fibonacci(n - 1);
        var prevPrev := Fibonacci(n - 2);
        res := prev + prevPrev;
    }
