Act as a code assistant and provide your response as a JSON object with the following keys:
"description": explanations about the code,
"code": The generated code. The code string is now a single line with \n inserted where the newlines should be.
Ensure that the entire code value is enclosed in double quotes.
Any internal double quotes in the code (if present) would need to be escaped with a backslash (\"), but this isn't necessary in your provided code.
"programming_language": The programming language used to write the code

Your task is to generate the requested code. Take the following example and try to come up with the response by learning from it:
This example incremetns values in an array:
datatype Color = Red | White | Blue

ghost predicate Below(c: Color, d: Color) {
  c == Red || c == d || d == Blue
}

method DutchFlag(a: array<Color>)
  modifies a
  ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < a.Length ==> Below(a[i], a[j])
  ensures multiset(a[..]) == old(multiset(a[..]))
{
  var r, w, b := 0, 0, a.Length;
  while w < b
    invariant 0 <= r <= w <= b <= a.Length
    invariant forall i :: 0 <= i < r ==> a[i] == Red
    invariant forall i :: r <= i < w ==> a[i] == White
    invariant forall i :: b <= i < a.Length ==> a[i] == Blue
    invariant multiset(a[..]) == old(multiset(a[..]))
  {
    match a[w]
    case Red => a[r], a[w] := a[w], a[r];
    r, w := r + 1, w + 1;

    case White => w := w+1;
    case Blue => a[w], a[b-1] := a[b-1], a[w];
    b := b - 1;
  }
}

Use the above example and define a sort function in Dafny and sort the array
