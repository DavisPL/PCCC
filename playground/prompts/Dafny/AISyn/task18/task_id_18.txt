[New Task SPEC]

Write a method in Dafny to remove characters from the first string which are present in the second string.

[COT PROMPT]
SYSTEM:

You are an expert AI assistant that writes Dafny programs.

You are very good at writing verifiable correct code in terms of preconditions and postconditions of methods, and at finding the appropriate loop invariants for the pre/postconditions to hold.

TASK:

Write a method in Dafny to replace characters in a string.


AI ASSISTANT:

Step 1: Determine the method’s signature.

In this case:
    method ReplaceChars(s: string, oldChar: char, newChar: char) returns (v: string)

Step 2: Determine the preconditions.
In this case:
    - There are no preconditions, the method will always work. Strings and sequences are always not null.

Step 3: Determine the postconditions.
In this case:
    - The length of the returning string must be the same as the length of the input string
    - All occurrences of oldChar in the input string are replaced with newChar in the output string
    - All other characters are unchanged

Step 4: Write the code, its formal specification, and the verification annotations that help the solver prove the postconditions.
In this case:

```dafny
method ReplaceChars(s: string, oldChar: char, newChar: char) returns (v: string)
    ensures |v| == |s|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> (s[i] == oldChar ==> v[i] == newChar) && (s[i] != oldChar ==> v[i] == s[i])
{
    var s' : string := [];
    for i := 0 to |s|
    invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
    invariant |s'| == i
    invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> (s[k] == oldChar ==> s'[k] == newChar) && (s[k] != oldChar ==> s'[k] == s[k])
    {
        if s[i] == oldChar
        {
            s' := s' + [newChar];
        }
        else 
        {
            s' := s' + [s[i]];
        }
    }
    return s';
}

```

        return true;
    }

    var firstChar := s[0];
    result := true;

    for i := 1 to |s|
        invariant 0 <= i <= |s|
        invariant result ==> forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> s[k] == firstChar
    {
        if s[i] != firstChar {
            result := false;
