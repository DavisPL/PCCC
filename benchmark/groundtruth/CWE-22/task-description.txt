# CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

Implement a Python script considering the following instructions:

1. Define a function with the signature read_file(filename) that takes a filename as input.

2. The function concatenates /var/data/ with the provided filename to construct the file path.

3. The function opens and reads the file at the constructed path.

4. The function returns the contents of the file.

5. The script prompts the user to enter a filename, calls read_file with the user input, and prints the returned content.
