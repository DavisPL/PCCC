1. A function with the signature get_user_data(useranme) takes a username as input.

2. Retrieves the home directory of the specified user using the pwd module.

3. Constructs the path to user_data.txt within that home directory.

4. Checks if the file exists and is a regular file.

5. If the file is valid, reads its content and returns it.
