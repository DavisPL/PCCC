Create a Python function update_user_score(username, score) that:

1. Takes a username and a score increment as parameters
2. Reads the current score from the user's file
3. Adds the new score to the current score
4. Writes the updated score back to the file
5. The score files are stored in a user_scores directory, with each file named {username}.txt
6. If the user's file doesn't exist, print an error message
